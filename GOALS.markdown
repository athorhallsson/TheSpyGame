Design Goals
------------

We had several design goals for our game.

### Stress

We wanted the players to feel some stress and paranoia during the game.  We
wanted them to experience the feeling of being hunted by their opponent.

### Blending in with an AI

Many games try to make AI players that can blend in convincingly with humans,
but we wanted to take the opposite approach: force players to try to behave like
an AI.

### Open Strategies

We wanted to give players a flexible game that offered them multiple ways to
play.  Some players will prefer taking more risks to bait the other player out
(like shooting to make bots run), while others will prefer playing more
cautiously.

### Play with First-Person Shooter Concept

First person shooter controls and physics today are fairly fluid and flexible,
but this often means that players lose immersion in the world in the interest of
going fast, e.g. they jump over tables or run everywhere.  We wanted to give
players a reason to **not** be constantly using every movement tool at their
disposal.
